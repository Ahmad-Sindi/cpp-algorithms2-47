# Algorithm Challenge #47 – Custom Round Function in C++

🧮 Problem Overview  
This challenge focuses on building a custom rounding function from scratch,
without relying on the built-in `round()` function provided by C++.

The program takes a floating-point number and rounds it according to
standard mathematical rules while handling both positive and negative values correctly.

📐 Rounding Logic

- Fraction ≥ 0.5 → Round up
- Fraction < 0.5 → Round down
- Negative numbers are handled using absolute fractional comparison

Examples:
- 10.7 → 11  
- 10.3 → 10  
- -10.7 → -11

🚀 Skills Practiced

- Separating integer and fractional parts of floating-point numbers
- Applying conditional logic for mathematical decisions
- Handling negative values correctly
- Writing clean and testable C++ functions
- Comparing custom algorithms with standard library functions
